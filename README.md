# User-Management-System
This is an incomplete project with many flaws but it led to a learning experience for my future. 

This was meant as a login/register system to have users be able to log into their accounts to play a game I created. However, I was not happy with how the GUI turned out after designing a part of it and deleted it. I had a self-reflection and realised that doing that is, in fact, negative. It can always be improved but starting from scratch and losing some possibly useable code is simply a loss. That is why I like this project; it provided a learning experience that positively affected me as a developer and possibly other aspects of my life.
